# Burger Builder App

This is the main application built as coursework for [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy taught by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/). The application is for customizing and ordering a hamburger. I wrote all of this code while following through the ~40-50 hours of lectures but at the end of the day this application is written by Max, not me.
